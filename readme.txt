This was a project that I did whilst at Vodafone in the Python Language.

Completed a project that has real world applications using python and also making sure that I plan and do it in an Agile way. 
The aim of the project was to develop a program that would anonymise sensitive C3 level data from a CSV file so that it could be safely 
uploaded onto GCP(for data analytics purposes), which is in the public domain.

The program uses a GUI which allows the user to upload a CSV file, Click a button which anonymise the contents and store the anonymised 
contents within an array.  The program made sure to allocate the same values with the same value, E.g. if the users location was newbury,
then that would be assigned the same value for all newbury cases.  There is also a feature to write anonymised contents to a file.
